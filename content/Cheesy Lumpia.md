## Ingredients

- 30 pieces lumpia wrapper
- 2 cups cooking oil
- 2 lbs. ground pork see note 1
- 8 pieces Mozzarella string cheese see note 2

## Filling ingredients
- 1 piece onion minced
- 2 teaspoons Knorr Liquid Seasoning
- 1 cup carrot minced
- 4 tablespoons cornstarch see note 3
- 1 egg
- Ground black pepper to taste

## Directions

1. Combine ground pork with the filling ingredients. Add Knorr Liquid seasoning. Mix everything together.
2 lbs. ground pork, 2 teaspoons Knorr Liquid Seasoning, 1 cup carrot, 4 tablespoons cornstarch, 1 egg, Ground black pepper to taste, 1 piece onion
2. Wrap the lumpia by laying a sheet of lumpia wrapper on a clean flat surface. Scoop around 1 Â½ tablespoons of mixture and spread it on one side of the wrapper. Put the sliced string cheese over and cover it completely with the meat mixture. Fold the sides of the wrapper inward, roll it, and secure the ends. Perform this step until the entire meat mixture is consumed.

4. Arrange on a serving plate and serve with ketchup. Share and enjoy!

##  Note

## Note 1: 
(ground pork) If ground pork is not available, you can manually mince pork shoulder until it gets fine to the point that it sticks to each other. As for those who want to use other types of protein, I recommend ground chicken.

## Note 2: 
(string cheese) I use store bought mozzarella string cheese. Feel free to use other types of easy melting cheeses if this is not available.
## Note 3: 
(cornstarch) You can all use all purpose flour or breadcrumbs as alternatives.
