## Ingredients

## Siomai Ingredients:
- 3 lbs. ground pork
- 1 cup shrimp minced see notes
- 12 ml. Knorr Liquid Seasoning
- ½ cup onion minced
- ½ cup carrot minced
- ¼ cup green onion minced
- 4 tablespoons cornstarch
- 1 piece egg
- 2 teaspoons sesame oil
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 50 pieces wonton wrapper

## Chili Garlic Oil Ingredients:
- 2 heads garlic peeled
- 1/4 lb Thai chili pepper
- 1 pieces star anise
- 2 pieces bay leaves
- 1 tablespoon white vinegar
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar see notes
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon oyster sauce see notes
## Directions

1. Prepare the shumai by combining pork, shrimp, onion, carrot, green onion, and egg in a bowl. Mix well and then add Knorr Liquid Seasoning, sesame oil, salt, and ground black pepper. Continue mixing until the ingredients are well distributed.
2. Gradually add the cornstarch as needed. Note: this is a binding ingredient that helps absorb moisture from the mixture.
3. Put steamer liners on your steamer. Arrange the siomai on top. Steam for 20 to 30 minutes.
4. Make the chili garlic oil by mincing the garlic and Thai chili pepper in a food processor.
5. Pour 1 1/2 cups of cooking oil in a wok and then add the minced garlic and chili peppers along with star anise and dried bay leaves. Turn on the heat of the stove to the lowest setting. Gradually stir the mixture while cooking for 30 to 45 minutes.
6. Add vinegar, brown sugar, salt, and oyster sauce unto the mixture. Continue cooking for 3 minutes.
7. Remove the star anise and dried bay leaves.
8. Arrange the siomai on a serving plate and top with chili garlic oil then serve with a dipping sauce composed of soy sauce and calamansi.
9. Share and enjoy!

## Notes:

## Oyster sauce: 
The recipe for chili garlic oil asks for oyster sauce. However, you can also use hoising sauce if you like it to taste more oriental and sweet.

## Shrimp: 
Siomai will taste better with shrimp, but you can always omit this ingredient for any reason. The outcome will still be good and delicious.

## Brown sugar:
 The brown sugar in the chili garlic oil can be replaced with white sugar. If you cannot use sugar at all, Splenda or any similar sugar substitutes.
