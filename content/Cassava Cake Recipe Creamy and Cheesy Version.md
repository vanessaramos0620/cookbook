## Ingredients

- 2 lbs. cassava grated
- 2 cups coconut cream
- 12 ounces evaporated milk
- 3 Eggs
- 3 tablespoons butter melted
- 1/2 cup quick-melt cheese shredded
- 14 ounces condensed milk

## Topping ingredients:
- 1 cup coconut cream
- 7 ounces condensed milk
- 1 cup quick-melt cheese shredded
- tablespoons butter melted 

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350F.
2. Combine the wet ingredients in a mixing bowl starting by cracking the eggs. Beat until smooth. Pour the evaporated milk, condensed milk, butter, and coconut milk. Whisk everything together until the mixture smoothens.
3. Add the grated cassava and Â½ cup cheese in the bowl where the wet ingredients are at. Mix well.
4. Transfer the mixture into a greased baking pan. Bake for 1 hour.
5. Prepare the topping my mixing all the toping ingredients in a clean bowl. Mix everything together. Set aside.
6. Pour the topping mixture over the baked cassava. Put the baking pan back in the oven. Continue baking for 350F until the topping thickens. Note: You will notice that it will burn a bit, that is normal.
7. Remove the baking pan from the oven. Let the cassava cake cool down.
8. Slice the cake into serving pieces. Serve for dessert.

## Notes:
- Grated cassava can be bought frozen from most Filipino grocery stores. Fresh cassava can also be used, make sure to grate it finely and then wring it before using.

- You should also be able to use an air fryer to cook the cassava cake. Set it to the same temperature, but make sure to cover the pan with aluminum foil in the first hour of cooking. Take the foil off and continue to air fry to finish the top.

- Adding macapuno strips to the mixture is a good way to level-up this recipe.
