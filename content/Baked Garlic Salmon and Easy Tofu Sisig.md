## Ingredients

## Garlic Salmon Ingredients:
- 2 lbs. salmon fillet
- ½ cup Lady’s Choice Mayonnaise
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- ¼ cup Parmesan cheese
- 3 tablespoons toasted garlic
- 1 teaspoon salt

## Tofu Sisig Ingredients:
- 1 lb. tofu cut into cubes
- 1 red bell pepper sliced
- 1 green bell pepper sliced

- 4 tablespoons butter unsalted

## Tofu Sisig Dressing:
- ½ cup Lady’s Choice Mayonnaise
- 2 teaspoons Knorr Liquid Seasoning Chili flavor
- ½ teaspoon onion Powder
- A dash of ground black pepper
- 3 tablespoons water

## Directions

1. Start making the tofu sisig by air frying the tofu for 15 minutes. Set it aside once done.
2. Make the dressing by combining all the tofu sisig dressing ingredients in a bowl. Mix well. Set aside.
3. Heat 2 tablespoons of butter in a pan. Saute the onion until it softens. Add bell peppers and continue cooking for 1 minute. Add the air fried tofu. Cook for 30 seconds.

4. Melt the remaining butter in a metal plate (sizzling plate). Transfer the tofu sisig and top with the dressing. Serve while its sizzling hot.
5. Meanwhile, start making the garlic salmon by preheating the oven to 180C (around 356F). Rub salt all over the salmon and arrange on a baking pan.
6. Make the topping by combining Lady’s Choice Mayonnaise and lemon juice. Mix well and spread over the salmon fillet.
7. Bake the salmon for 12 to 15 minutes. Top with Parmesan cheese and toasted garlic. Serve. Share and enjoy!
