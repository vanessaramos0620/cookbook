   * Sub Step One or Notes
2. Arrange the prosciutto slices on the baking sheet so they donâ€™t touch, and bake them in the preheated oven until crisp, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from the oven, and let cool.
3. Stack the tortillas on a plate and microwave them on High until warmed and pliable, 20 to 30 seconds.
4. Spread each tortilla with 2 tablespoons of hummus spread, and top each with 3 slices of crisped prosciutto per wrap. Place a slice of mozzarella cheese on top of the prosciutto, and spread 1/4 of the avocado slices per wrap on the cheese. Top each wrap with 1 sliced tomato and about 1/4 cup of torn lettuce leaves.
5. Fold the bottom of each tortilla up about 2 inches to enclose the filling, and roll the wrap tightly into a compact cylinder.
