## Ingredients

- 3 pounds beef chuck roast
- 3 (1 ounce) packages dry Italian salad dressing mix

## Directions

1. Place the roast into a slow cooker, and season with Italian dressing mix. Pour in the water.
2. Cover, and cook on High for 6 to 7 hours.
3. During the last hour, shred the meat with two forks - if it does not shred easily, cook longer.
   1. Add the peppers, and as much of the juice as you like for additional flavor. Serve on buns.
